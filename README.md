# Stock Return Prediction Project

## Introduction

Predicting stock returns is a notoriously challenging task due to the complex and dynamic nature of financial markets. However, advancements in machine learning provide powerful tools to tackle this challenge. This project leverages Python for automation and analysis, aiming to identify effective approaches for predicting monthly returns within the S&P 500 market.

## Overview

The project follows a multi-step approach:

1. **Data Acquisition**  
   We automate the process of scraping relevant data, including:
   - Acquiring the list of S&P 500 companies from Wikipedia.
   - Downloading daily historical stock prices for each company from Yahoo Finance.

2. **Data Processing**  
   The collected data is transformed to focus on monthly returns for the period 2010-2023. This timeframe provides a robust dataset for model training and evaluation.

3. **Machine Learning Model Exploration**  
   Several machine learning models are trained and compared to predict next month's return, including:
   - **Linear Regression with Ridge Regularization**: For stability and regularization.
   - **Random Forest Regressor**: For capturing complex relationships.
   - **MLPRegressor**: A type of neural network for non-linear patterns.
   - **Decision Tree Regressor**: For interpretability.

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   Model performance metrics are analyzed to identify the most effective approach for predicting monthly returns within the S&P 500.

Data is extracted from diverse sources such as Yahoo Finance, Wikipedia, and Edgar to ensure a comprehensive analysis, providing a more holistic understanding of the factors influencing stock returns.
